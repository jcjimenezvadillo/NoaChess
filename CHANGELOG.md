# CHANGELOG

## 2026-07-06 (v0.2.0)

- engine: quiescence search at the horizon (stand pat + MVV-LVA ordered captures and queen promotions), removing the horizon effect.
- engine: transposition table (Zobrist-keyed, depth-preferred replacement, Exact/LowerBound/UpperBound bounds, mate-score ply normalization).
- engine: aspiration windows around the previous iteration score, with full-window re-search on fail.
- engine: move ordering pipeline — TT move, MVV-LVA captures, killer moves, history heuristic (`MovePicker`, `KillerTable`, `HistoryTable`).
- engine: Late Move Reductions for late quiet moves, with null-window probe and full-depth re-search.
- engine: search limits and basic time management; default depth raised from 4 to 6 plies.
- uci: `go movetime N` and `go wtime/btime/winc/binc` (budget = clock/30 + increment/2); `info` lines include `time` and `nps`; `ucinewgame` clears engine state.
- gui: background analysis deepened to 12 plies and now warms the shared transposition table (real pondering); searches are serialized (cancel + await) so engine state is never mutated concurrently.
- tests: transposition table semantics, mate in two, horizon-blunder avoidance, time-limit compliance.

## 2026-07-05 (v0.1.3)

- core: bitboard+mailbox board, full legal move generation, FEN, Zobrist hashing, incremental make/unmake, game-over detection, Perft-validated.
- engine: alpha-beta (negamax) with iterative deepening and progress reporting; classical evaluation (material + piece-square tables).
- uci: console host with uci, isready, ucinewgame, position, go depth, quit.
- gui: WPF (MVVM) click-click play vs the engine, highlights, promotion dialog, board flip, Cburnett SVG pieces, live status bar with evaluation/depth, background analysis on the user's turn.

## 2025-06-04 (v0.1.0-alpha)

- project: repo created and initial documentation setup (README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, CODE_OF_CONDUCT).
- infra: established branch workflow (`main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`).
- infra: added LICENSE with legal disclaimer and Spanish notice.
- infra: added CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (bilingual).
- infra: added .gitignore (Dotnet).
- doc: initial roadmap and project structure defined in README.
